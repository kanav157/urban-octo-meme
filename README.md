IN THIS TASK2 I CREATED A TO-DO LIST IN WHICH I ADDED A HEADING USING H1 AND THEN AADED A INPUT SPACE AND A PLACEHOLDER AND A BUTTON AS WELL IN THE BUTTON I ADDED A TRANSITION OF BOX SHADOW. THE MAIN WORK WAS IN JS . IN JS I FIRST INITIALIZE EACH AND VERY BUTTON I NEED AND THEN MADE A FUNCTION FOR IF THE THERE IS NO INPUT IF THERE IS NO INPUT THEN IT WILL ISSUE A ALERT DISPLAYING ENTER A TASK. THEN CREATED A DELETE BUTTON AND A LIST WHICH WILL DISPLAY THE TASKS WE INPUTED AND DELETE BUTTON WILL DELETE THE TASKS
